**enerflow** is a Python framework for modeling sequential decision problems in the energy sector. It is based on both OpenAI Gym (now [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)) and [Warran Powell's decision framework](https://castle.princeton.edu/rlso/). enerflow enables you to: 

* 🛤️ Structure your code as modular and reusable components and adopt the "model first, then solve"-mantra. 
* 🏗️ Build agents, predictors, optimizers and simulators to solve sequential decision problems
* 🌱 Forumate your problems as environments and evalute pre-existing solutions
* 🧪 Run parametrized experiments that generate reproducible results (code, data and parameters)
* ➿ Run sweeps for benchmarking, scenario analysis and parameter tuning

**🚀 [Quickstart - Try out now in Colab](-)**

As energy systems world-wide continue to decarbonise through deployment of renewable and fossil-free energy, they are also becoming more intermittent and complex. We need better data-driven methods to handle this complexity, with `python` rapidly becoming the tool-of-choice for energy modellers.
