Introduction
============

The `emflow` project is a cutting-edge framework designed for the modeling and analysis of energy resources. Utilizing the principles of the OpenAI Gym API, it offers a flexible and interactive environment where various approaches to energy management and optimization can be tested and benchmarked.

Purpose
=======

Philosophy
- Python-first
- Problem-centric
- Reusable and modular
- Verification and validation
- Enables benchmarking
- Model-first approach is the Mantra
- Model agnostic
- 

The core objective of `emflow` is to facilitate research and development in the field of energy resources. By providing a standardized and extensible platform, it allows researchers, engineers, and data scientists to:

- Model diverse energy resources and systems.
- Implement and test a variety of optimization algorithms.
- Benchmark different approaches under consistent conditions.
- Explore innovative strategies for efficient energy management.
