Walkthrough of the `enflow` framework
---------------------------------

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to setting up and running a simulation using the `enflow` library. Follow these steps to create a comprehensive energy resource simulation.

Step 1: Define Your Energy Assets
---------------------------------

Begin by defining the energy assets in your simulation. This includes any resources, facilities, equipment, or other entities involved in your energy model.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define your energy assets
    assets = enflow.define_assets(...)
    # Add more details specific to your energy assets.

Step 2: Specify Dynamic State Variables
---------------------------------------

Next, outline the dynamic state variables. These are the variables that represent the state of your energy system and will change over time during the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define state variables
    state_variables = enflow.define_state(...)
    # Provide more specifics about your state variables.

Step 3: Define Action Variables
-------------------------------

Now, define the action variables. These are the variables that represent the actions or decisions that can be made in your environment.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define action variables
    actions = enflow.define_actions(...)
    # Elaborate on the possible actions in your simulation.

Step 4: Create the Environment
------------------------------

Create the simulation environment. This includes defining the transition function, which describes how the state of the system changes in response to actions.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create the environment
    environment = enflow.create_environment(assets, state_variables, actions)
    # Further details on setting up the environment.

Step 5: Establish the Objective Function
----------------------------------------

Define the objective function. This function should quantify the goal of the simulation, such as minimizing costs or maximizing efficiency.

.. code-block:: python

    # Define the objective function
    objective = enflow.define_objective(...)
    # Additional information on your specific objective function.

Step 6: Design Agents' Policies
-------------------------------

Design the policy for your agents. This involves specifying the strategy that the agents will use to make decisions in the environment.

.. code-block:: python

    # Design agent policies
    agent_policy = enflow.design_policy(...)
    # More details on how to design and implement these policies.

Step 7: Run the Simulated Environment
-------------------------------------

Finally, run the simulation with the defined assets, environment, and agent policies. Analyze the output to evaluate the performance of your model.

.. code-block:: python

    # Run the simulation
    simulation_results = enflow.run_simulation(environment, agent_policy)
    # Instructions on how to run and what to expect from the simulation.

Conclusion
----------

Following these steps will allow you to create a detailed and functional simulation using the `enflow` library. Explore different configurations and policies to fully understand the capabilities and dynamics of your energy resource model.
